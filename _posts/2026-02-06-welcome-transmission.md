This is the first Transmission — a localized archive of updates from the <a href="https://luciferread.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Éskhatos Kósmos Chronicles</a>.

While these messages are broadcast via <a href="https://luciferread.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Substack</a>, I believe in keeping a record anchored here, on my own station. Platforms drift. Signals fade. Archives endure. No matter what happens out there in the void, this ensures the connection remains intact.

### What these transmissions contain:
*   Monthly progress updates on my debut novel, *The Radiants*, and the opening saga of the *Heliopaides*
*   Early glimpses of later books and worlds still taking shape
*   Reflections on science — both imagined and real — that inform the universe I’m building

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do so below or via the [Home Page]({{ '/' | relative_url }}) to receive future transmissions directly.

End transmission.
